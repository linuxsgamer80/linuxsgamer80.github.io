Are you wondering how to install Firefox on Arch Linux? It is super simple. All you have to do is the following: 
1) Run:
```
sudo pacman -Sy firefox --noconfirm
```
The firefox package, or binary, is stored within the repository. By running that command within your terminal emulator, it tells pacman, the tool that grabs packages, to install firefox without
prompting the user (hence the --noconfirm flag).

If you want to install from a GUI, you can use PAMAC, an *appstore* of sorts. It does everything the command above does, but with a point-and-click interface. All you have to do is: 
1) Run Pamac, which is *Add/Remove Software* application that has a box icon. 
2) Search for firefox
3) Hit the down arrow and put in your password when prompted. 
4) Find the application in your App Drawer/App Menu

Installing Firefox is not hard! See! 

Thanks, and I hope this helps,
